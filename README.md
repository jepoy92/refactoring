Horiseon Refactoring Project

Greetings and salutations folks! As the premiere html editor for Horiseon my duty was to streamline our landing page's code to improve our SEO
as well as fix the syntax issues with the site. We aim to deliver the highest quality of digital marketing for our clients and wanted to bring
our website inline with our company's goals. As such, this project was dubbed the "Horiseon Refactoring Project" and we are happy to share the 
changes we have made with our site.
